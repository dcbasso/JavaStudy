# Java Projects

### graphql

First project using GraphGL, using Spring.


### Redis

Java Project using Java 17, with SpringBoot, Gradle, Test Containers, Junit5, Mockito and others.

This project is using a Redis Database (NoSQL) to persist some simple data there, just for showing the concept of using the Redis and the implementation for it (at this moment I'm using CrudRepository to persist Data).

In this project I have separeted sources sets of Tests, one for Unit Tests and another source to Integration Tests (That uses test container).
